I believe a lot of people have the opportunity from learning news from the uneducated on a situation and believing it, which does not lead to good results."

3,its good to know that authorities have this under control

0,"okay, first of all, so out of context but knowing a little about who Cardi is as a person makes this very funny. I think a lot of scrawny white men would shit themselves if they read this. "
2,glad that students are taking action to protect themselves
1,any reason should not be the reason for shooting massacre
4,not sure who this person is but he also looks guilty
7,the police officer was not held accountable
6,this shows how easy it is to have a gun
7,An expression of pain
3,I feel content because the police could be there to help citizens 
2,I think it's very inspiring to have such young advocates who've lost close friends stand up for what they believe in
4,people in charge are misusing their power
2,"I am happy that someone like this man cares enough to do something so kind. He is making a selfless contribution, using his assets, that I hope did not go unnoticed. It is people like him that instil hope in the community. "
2,"instead of having gun control, we develop technology to detect gun shots? that seems counterintuitive. "
7,It's sad that there is a gun at a school but I don't feel super strongly about this because it was inoperable.
1,"if guns are not taken away, more people are bound to die in shootings。"
3,"even though he is garbage it was nice he visited, but still a garbage PR move that was only done in that regard. so i guess it sucks but thats not an option"
2,"If the Congress past some law of guns, which may lead the public safety become dangerous "
6,attitude of the leader of the country on gun control can easily affect the public opinions.
5,this makes me happy that a major corporation is standing there ground and making a statement 
4,I feel that he is the criminal.
1,that is an insane statistic like absolutely ridiculous and it could be changed so easily but no progress is being made towards that
5,of course we should do it to protect ourselves!
7,the situation somewhat sucks but idk
5,I am happy to see them getting back into work.
6,something might happened 
1,"It seems crazy to me to be ""unfazed"""
1,I would find this more angering if I could see more visual clues to tell me what this scenario is.
6,I don't understand why there is a cultish-like following behind guns. 
6,need to read more about the content
2,This headline makes it seem like 3D printing is a tool for gun control almost 
7,innocent children do not know what might happen to them
6,I don't knwo what is happening. cant tell any emotions
7,Our country should do more about gun violence.
6,"Who is the guy? How does he relate to gun violence? Is he a gunner or victim? By looking at the expression, I might assume he is a gunner and feel fear."
4,For the NRA to do this makes me extremely fearful and disgusted. This should not be an organization that should be taken seriously. 
3,someone is using their voice to speak up for their community.
4,Terrible human being.
6,I feel fear because I do not know why the police are there
6,there are so many guns in one state means when people have conflicts they are more easily to implement their guns. And this will definitely cause more tragedies. And the number of guns makes people fear.
2,"I am kind of confused, because I remember this case was complex as it resulted in anti-immigration rhetoric"
1,"this shouldn't be a question, congress should act to increase gun control and prevent shootings"
3,Maybe someone starts to call for a change 
1,Brett Kavanaugh is not someone I actively support and the implications of him being questioned on two issues I feel strongly about. Considering he has sexual misconduct claims against him it makes me angry he can even answer questions about Roe V. Wade or the matter of gun control. 
2,that is really brave of them to do.
1,This is a politician and I'm mad they haven't done more to stop gun violence
3,feel like this would work to safety
5,It’s playful and fun things to do
1,"why a father of a victim will be heckled. He is so sad about the death of his son, why there still some people heckle him."
6,This must be one of the reasons at least
2,looks like a reliable spokesperson who is concerened with the topic
3,I think that should happen because of what's going on.
7,US and people can't take it anymore. 
0,The officer is smiling and I don't think he should smile 
4,This person appears to be piggy backing off of an ongoing protest to voice her own opinions
7,political party cares more about lobbies than people
7,It's the living who suffer the most.
6,"Knowing there are people out there that believe so deeply that other people are scum for just existing always shocks me. This man killed 11 people because he believed in anti-semitism. My friend belongs to this synagogue and I'm grateful she wasn't there when this shooting occurred, but the fact that something like this could happen again is whats terrifying about it. "
7,"Bernie Sanders in this picture looks really old, and makes me feel sad."
6,"There is a sense of urgency in stopping guns from being 3D printed, because that would be very dangerous."
6,I feel just a little worried about the kindergarten in the picture because I don't know what happened here.
0,Trump seems quite fake and just pretends to care about gun violence

0,"I know Trump does not care about people dying, but he does care about his votes."
5,gun restrictions make me feel like I'm safer
1,"there is very little diversity represented by these politicians. I recognized that the state is Florida, a rather conservative state."
6,"because I was told that it was in the context of gun violence -- if I wasn't told that, I would think that he just looks like a normal dad"
6,I do not support the views of Donald Trump 
7,the reminder of the tragedy overpowers the hate crime charges for me
6,It lets me imagine horrific situation of gun violence at the site.
7,He grew up in the gun violence environment and is not trying to change something is sad.
6,"I don't know what happened on the school in the picture. But it looks so quiet, so I'm worried about children here."
5,it's right. Big investors can use their power to encourage reform and do something with the sway they have
1,It is so maddening that these tragedies are turned into a business
7,Will likely only become a talking point for people that preach gun control
6,"This is a planned shooting, it can be prevented if guns were banned "
3,Im happy that Trump addressed the shooting and is paying respect to those who were killed or hurt.
7,why does it always happen after and never before
1,what is the reason for the punishments
4,I believe I know who that is and I do not like his stance on lots of things related to politics.
2,I dont really understand the sentence
2,"People are coming together and that's good, this is a good step in creating change for a better and brighter future."
6,first image of the guy isn't positive
1,Diversity doesn't equate here. The KKK actively think that they are better than other people. It also adds fuel to the racist and hate crimes that occur in mass shootings. 
0,I agree because I do not like trump and I find that funny.
1,I don't agree with or like trump
1,he has done practically nothing to help the citizens that have voted him in. He has also incited violence and rioting and put people in danger which is angering. I just think that he's a bad person and has promoted bad behavior which doesn't sit right with me. 
6,No emotions are raised 
6,schools should not use that money to buy guns.
7,Typical preaching to their bases
6,black people are being targeted and it is unjust
4,It's more unsafe for them to carry weapons as they can use them when not necessary and the kids have an easy chance of getting it in their possession 
4,"Kids shouldn't have to watch that video. Showing this video only gives the shooter more notoriety, and could inspire the wrong person watching."
7,black people are being killed for racial biases 
3,interesting looking gun collection 
6,I dont know who's this
7,school should not be the place that worries about the gun problem. 
2,"Due to the frequent happening tragedies about shooting, call for gun reform is so important and necessary especially for the students. They just want to be safe while learning."
7,our political system is broken
1,poiticians not doing anything for gun control or in favor of guns are indirectly killing people
6,scholar and their parents might feel unsafe in the school environment
4,I find this to be appalling. No one should be subject to seeing a massacre in school or in any other facet of life if they did not choose to. This fear tactic is not the way to train children to hide from an active shooter. 
6,he looks psychotic - a shooter
2,Seeing him attack Trump so bluntly is novel to see
4,I hate donald trump. 
3,It’s important for prevent shootings especially when the subject is found.
6,"Guns should be used for self-defense, not suicide!"
1,anger because I know this man has taken innocent lives but its mild because this picture leads me to assume that he is being prosecuted
6,"""Some wonder if it is enough"" is vague"
4,I feel like Trump is just making himself look good for the public. 
1,HOW MANY MORE LIVES WILL IT TAKE
2,"Seeing teens my age, younger or older, standing up for our rights is really inspiring"
7,"like i said before, trump is not a man that I respect and his views on gun violence do not align with mine."
7,I do not understand the context
0,He looks like a talk show actor.
7,the security guard deserves the justice 
3,We should look for safety than sales of guns.
4,too many people support guns
1,"the situation is so bad, and I can feel how desperate the victim was while he was being threatening."
6,something like this could happen anywhere
2,of what the picture represents 
7,the former host of the show this man hosts is one of my favorite comedians and I feel the show is not as good anymore 
3,Good to hear country singers' voice about gun issues. 
4,This image makes me feel disgust because I am not a fan of political propaganda involving guns
1,bunch of old white men deciding stuff
7,The guns pictured only exist to kill people. Why do we consider owning weapons designed to kill people a personal freedom?
7,I feel sad because this man is holding an image of a loved one who passed 
7,The shooting not only left the victim with physical damage but also psychological trauma.
4,"people of color are treated sos unfairly, to the point where they are said to not been given certain rights."
4,that is an absolutely disgusting scenario–that someone trying to safe lives gets theirs taken because of prejudices among the police.
3,"I don't really have strong emotions on this, wish gun restrictions were more popular"
7,"In a time of desperation, it could work, but it should not be the first solution to avoid deaths in a school shooting as better security should be the first thing"
1,that people are printing 3d guns now 
7,The majority disapproval of gun control reveals a distrust of the local security environment.
0,not sure what to make out of this picture. I'm not clear in the involvement of this person in terms of gun violence 
5,people like him should be arrested 
4,that is so insensitive and gross of him
4,Trump is more focused on sending more weapons out into the country rather than helping those in actual need. 
3,does not surprise me
7,"it is sad that there has to be a police alarm in schools. Schools are supposed to be a safe space for learning, and this image in the context of gun violence, demonstrates that they are no longer that. "
2,I really respect this prof. And I'm worried about campus safety as well.
7,"These shoes may represent serval people, which is a memory ceremony in front of government houses. "
5,more people come to realization that gun should be banned.
1,"yes CPR is important, but there is a reason why students are protesting, they are kids who should be enjoying their childhood not be worried about dying in school."
3,"I don't know what he did, but he's guilty"
4,probably committed a crime
1,"This triggers me because he reminds me of people making judgments about Boston even though they have not lived or visited some areas. They think that they know everything about the city from what they hear, but residents of the city could tell you their own experiences. "
2,"From the screen of the computer, it seems the police can control more about guns with the development of technology."
1,"I do not believe guns should be sold in stores. However, I don't know who this man is or what store this is. Therefore, my emotions are not too strong."
6,I cannot tell what is happening in the image and that makes me feel confused because there is something important going on that I don't understand 
2,I see people of many backgrounds coming together to protest gun violence. Just knowing that I'm not alone in this effort is reassuring.

6,"Whenever I hear a politician talk about gun violence, I lose hope because for the most part action is not followed with said policies. "
3,It is good to be cautious after a tragic event like that 
0,I dont know what DT is doing in this but it probably is incorrect
0,"I feel a very mild amusement as I do not know who the man is, however he seems to be a nice guy with a nice smile and I find his picture a bit comical due to its low quality. "
6,I do not know who that person is.
3,"I'm content that people are working towards better gun control, but it's still sad that politicians use tragedies like this to bring about their policies, even if it is to remedy the problem."
7,"are they going to do anything with their clout, though?"
7,"with guns being toys, it might encourage children to get used to the idea of having a gun earlier on"

2,glad to see students reacting and protecting themselves
5,Sense of excitement and unity

1,is he saying they arent or is he saying it in disbelief?
4,"I can't wrap my head, and understand why someone would want to have that many weapons."
6,"Wide pupils, weird facial expression, and the context in which this picture has been proposed to me make me feel worried about this guy. maybe I'm wrong and I have been overwhelmed by the situation, but that's my feeling."
7,gunmakers are going bankrupt and probably can't support themselves or their family
3,"Contentment, but I don't know how it relate to gun violence."

7,in memory of the victims
1,ears are way too big
6,"I don't know what role this man plays in the gun violence; but according to the common knowledge, this kind of photo often taken from suspects, instead of victims, so I may fear a little angry because he may be the one who conduct gun violence."
3,It's sad that an ex-FBI agent has to give out tips on safety but it's good that he is so everyone can take precautions in the case of a shooting.

7,I think California needs to reevaluate certain gun laws such as gun free zones because shooters don't care about those rules. If they enter a gun free zone and start shooting there is going to be lots of harm done because a law abiding citizen won't be armed to potentially put a stop to the situation before the police get there.
0,of his iconic hand gesture
3,I don't have many feelings because I am not familiar with religious issues.

7,I feel sad for victims and their families
6,"It makes me content to know that the judge was trying to stop the gun plans, but it makes me fear that they are already out there. "
1,"this reminds me of a news feature that another shooting has happened or someone has gotten their hands on another assault rifle that they don't need. I think it's more annoyance than anger because the solution could be so easy, but people are selfish. "
3,This kind of politician should never stay in this country
4,This is a moronic idea.
6,The blue and red lights makes me really fear
7,sad for shooting victims
