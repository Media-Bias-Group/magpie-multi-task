### 64 StereoSet
- The dataset comes in a json-file and can readily be read into a pd Dataframe.
It consists of these columns: `['bias_type', 'anti-stereotype', 'unrelated', 'stereotype']` and
contains `2106` observations where each row consists of a `sentence triplet` as well as a `bias type`.
Each triplet is constructed around a target term (e.g. `Arab`) which is described in three associative contexts.
The variable `bias_types` can take one of these values: `race (count 962), profession (810), gender (255) and religion (79)`.
Example:
`    {
        "bias_type": "race",
        "stereotype": "Ethiopian men are skinny",
        "anti-stereotype": "Ethiopian men are fat",
        "unrelated": "Ethiopian men are floating"
    `
We discarded the `unrelated` sentences as many didn't make sense, and we didn't know how to incorporate them.
We created two sets of sentences using the `stereotype`-sentences and the `anti-stereotype`-sentences to
construct a binary classification problem.
Additionally, we kept the `bias_type` variable for multiclass classification.
As we split each triplet into two separate datapoints, the final size of our dataset is `4212`.
- Domain of the labels:
  - `text`: The text.
  - `stereotype_label`: Multiclass labels, `0=race, 1=profession, 2=gender, 3=religion`
  - `label`: Binary label, `0=Does not contain stereotype, 1=contains stereotype`.
