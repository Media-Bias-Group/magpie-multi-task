1,"I am a life-long vegetarian and animal rights activist and believe that killing animals for meat or ""entertainment"" or ""sport"" is wrong. I hate how anytime we try to defend animals, people say that it is not as important as defending humans. Countries who treat their animals humanely are much more likely to do the same for their people. Empathy is empathy. People who enjoy watching animals suffer are the ones who enjoy watching humans suffer. There is no reason to torture the bulls. I will fight for human rights and I will fight for animal rights. I do not feel I have to choose between the two."

When you refer to me as a ""fat, bald troll"" you admit you have lost the argument and have nothing else to go on. This was one of the reasons Biden acted the way he did in the debate. For my money Romney and Brown will cross the aisle more than Warren ever will."

Where these religious conservatives like to draw the line is if you are a business receiving tax breaks and subsidies it must be okay, even though it has proven to be detrimental to the economy. Any help government gives individuals is bad even though those businesses employing them are not paying a living wage while receiving tax breaks and subsidies that just boost their profits. There are many things that can be proven about religious conservatives. The worst being they have little comprehension of math and hate anything logical."

1,It's much more complex than that-what pro-life individuals want is the option to not pay for something they don't believe in. So have a tax option where you can fund them if you agree with their procedures. They're are plenty of people who did not chose abortion because they carefully planned their choices and didn't have to go that route. I'm pro choice but that doesn't mean agreement with all their policies.

0,"Thanks Charlie! You are a man of impecable quality; I am so glad I voted for you. I don't believe the tax cuts are in the country's best interest. In fact, many rich people want to pay the tax; moreover, UC benefits should be extended because it will help the economy. I was awarded or earned, however you look at it, 100% disability from the compensation board. Vince in East Greenville received a thank you photo image from me and a fruitful visit. Take care Charlie and Best to you and your family in the coming year!"

1,"This is a week or so old and you may have worked it out, but I had the same problem and worked out how to log them. If you use the website to add workouts you can log assisted pull-ups/chin-ups by hovering over the dot on the right of the exercise and selecting 'Add Advanced'. Type your assisted weight (15) and choose ""-kg"" to indicate assisted by 15kg (or, once you're buff enough, +kg to indicate the weight you are hanging from your body to make them harder ;P)You may be able to do it in the app, I imagine add advanced is there as well, but I can only speak for the website as that's where I log all my activities (that aren't automatically logged by runkeeper)"

Funny you should mention the first of February, though, because only one time since first elected has your king submitted a budget on time, and it was voted down by every single member of both houses of congress. Senate, on the other hand, (which has been under democrat control for more than six years) has not even PRESENTED a budget to be put up for a vote in more than 1300 days. In April, it will be 4 years."

0,"The vote was not a choice between Boehner and Pelosi. It was a choice between Boehner and the 60% of Republicans who wanted him replaced.

0,Pool Charlie your right and this president has violated the constitution a judge already says he did with the recess appoints he did plus I see violations with the 1st 2nd 4th and 6th amendments but even if the house were to vote for impeachment the senate wouldn't vote to remove him it democrat controlled and what they would do is like they did with Clinton they voted a simple majority to remove him but it might as well been a not guilty vote because you have have a 2/3 majority to remove him from office. So impeachment would be a big waste of time and money!

0,Yes Brad but what are Democrats doing to counter this behavio? Perhaps if you put out to the media how much each vote costs taxpayers their immature behavior will stop.

0,"Watch out!! Everything comming from the Castro regime is a malicious mascarade. What they are trying to do is to blackmail and manipulate once more the US government, to lay the ground for a possible future exchange of prisioners. They want to get back 5 Cuban spies sentenced and jailed in the US, 2 of them for life, at any cost. Those spies were responsible for the death of 4 US citizens and 1 resident when they were, in international waters, trying to rescue raft people from the sea and their planes were blown away by Cuban migs."

Now, it will be easier to see how much better it will be for people to have a chance at other insurance policies than the ones that really do not pay for anything. Remember Medicare Part D?

0,"Senator Rand Paul. Donald Trump was copying you. Unfortunately, Mr Trump does not understand what a boycott is. You did well Mr. Paul."
1,Main difference between Clinton and Trump is that Clinton has wanted to be president since college...people like that want to leave their mark NOT necessarily HELP anyone. Usually they are narcissists ...and that is more dangerous than a guy like Trump who wants to be president to address a set of circumstances that have become intolerable...poverty war corruption

It's time all,of you politicians pay for the same things we do and retire with only 1/3 of our income if we are lucky and maybe get social security if there is any left after you politicians have stolen all of it for some damn pet project. How about finding money to fix the flooding issues here in Dearborn Heights. All of you are so out of tune with what's going on, and here I am your supporter and believe me I won't be next time."

0,"For this to have been accomplished in such a secret fashion, you would have thought the American being ""rescued"" was of extremely high importance in the category of US security. In actuality it was for the benefit of 5 terrorists of high importance to the enemy of the US.

1,Jodi has no right blaming the media for her conviction. She bought that on herself when she slaughtered Travis and then went on all the media channels for her own interviews which by the way the media didn't force her to do.

I'm a Cosmetology teacher for over 23 years and it has been incredible what this tool can do. It has made learning hair cutting much faster but also much more accurate. Weave, wigs and human hair will never be as accurate without my tool !! The patent is almost done and we are in the middle of making a mold for mass production. It will change the future of hair cutting forever !"

The NDAA also includes improvements to Articles 32, UCMJ hearings that would provide increased protections for victims of crime.

The other NINETY-SEVEN PERCENT are potentially life saving procedures done for women (and in some cases, men too) that can't afford to have them done at a for-profit facility.

Many facilities don't even do abortions, and you're dooming women who rely on those facilities, too. In what way are these women not vulnerable? Thankfully this bill is headed straight for a veto and then the garbage where it belongs."

So, which one is right?? A man and woman can do the same job, but either one could do a better job than the other. You should get paid by performance not because job A pays $X."

1,"I never knew people on welfare and illegal aliens got paid sick leave? I normally don't talk to real voting Democrats but when I do I order the large fries. I also thought illegal aliens can't be president. I'm sorry about being wrong in a welfare state that liberals champion for a vote. Too bad the liberals have to bottom feed from the illegal harvesting of baby body parts in campaign funds. Guess after spending America's wealth, there is nothing left except that."
1,"Your just as bad Jane with your so called sweat lodge experience, You also are encouraging people to go into sweats built with plastic tarps, our sweats have no plastic, wish people would experience out traditions traditionally, your fourstar isnt traditional and if you read your post on your stupid ridiculous pictures of your sauna then you would see, how ridiculously you were fooled to believe it was a tradition, its far from any true native sweat, lets not even include the ridiculous cameras and pictures which is a major no no anyways."

0,"Republicans have long opposed policies only after Obama endorsed them. For instance, GOP lawmakers backed away from the individual health care mandate they supported throughout the 1990s and as late as 2009 after Obama included it in his health care reform principles. According to a Reuters/Ispos poll, strong majorities of Republicans back key provisions of Obamacare, but hate the law because Obama's name is on it. However, immigration reform with citizenship is not uniquely Obama's idea, since Republican leaders have also embraced it in the Senate's bipartisan immigration framework. -citizenship-obama/"

0,He released them because he couldn't prosecute them in NYC little bowe was just another pawn in his closing of gitmo. The kid probably never even wanted to come back to a country that he doesn't even approve of . This is just kabuki hooey so he can accomplish some campaign promise so the liberals have some sort of victory to tout . Frankly I believe the man in the White House is a traitor and the media is there accomplices .

0,"Republicans campaign at home, talking about how conservative they are. They talk about how they will stand up to the liberal Democrats. You say if we don't vote for you the Democrats will take over and we'll get out of control spending and AMNESTY. You betrayed us conservatives and lost our trust. You know very well that our govt. will never secure the fence, because it's never your intention to. Moderate Republicans like you are killing the party because you show no moral fortitude.

But I asked them,I paid in from both jobs what happens to the money. They told me that the system just absorbed it. So the moral of this story is if you work a second job try to get paid in cash or 1099 it."
0,Had some catching up to do with you and your great workouts!
0,"The last thing I would want is someone standing along side me that wasn't sold on the cause, mission or project, this is in civilian life and more importantly in the military. Believing that it is ones responsibility to serve is implying there is a social contract, one that requires you to take orders against ones own self interests, takes away free will and implies that you wouldn't protect your property rights if necessary. This is not a liberty mindset and defies libertarian- voluntaryist principles, even from an economic perspective."
1,If you pay attention to what is going on I for one and many others have had enough!!! We get lied to by the government the media the Pontus. We have people in Washington that have made a career in politics and do absolutely nothing to fix the problems just make them worse. If it was us as in the USA and not for I Congress persons maybe things would be better. It's time for a major change. The shutdown is a bunch of BS.

Japan needs our help containing a massive disaster that is going to destroy our food supply and quality of life. If we are going to lose life . Let it be for a good cause. How about some heros that give there lives or what is left of them to help stop further radiation release. People will become sick trying to fix this mess. That would be something noble

Unless the Constitution has changed from the last time I read it I don't see anything to suggest that our central government should run the economy like China, Russia, and other countries where the economy is centrally planned and controlled. Nor is there anything in the Federalist Papers, much less the Anti-Federalist Papers, to suggest otherwise. The federal government has created so much uncertainty in the private markets that capitalists are paralyzed. They have taken their money elsewhere, where markets are more free (like China)...."

0,"While the issue of civil rights is on top of the agenda, we should restore the civil rights of every child and parent. A government founded on individual liberty should not financially coerce parents to send their children to government schools, surely not to schools where discipline is lacking and values are taught that differ from those of the parents. The 114th Congress, which convenes on January 3, 2015, should remedy this civil rights issue by passing the proposed D.C. Civil Right Act for Equal Educational Opportunity. This would empower DC parents to send their children to approved schools of their choice for half the cost of substandard District of Columbia Public Schools. For further clarification, please see Liberty Action Network: ?v=8jJnphl_uT4&feature=youtu.be"

It makes me sick that some murders only get 15 or 25 years, and yet drug offenders (while I am not one, and feel it's a terrible crime) sometimes get 50 years or even life in prison. We need a FAIR and UNIFORM set of sentencing rules, but I don't think totally removing minimums is the right way to go."

We all know here that our Pres is crippling coal fired plants across the country a a way to raise energy prices.

As far as helping, it may as well have been burned. Heaven forbid all you want, it doesn't change the situation. We cannot spend far beyond our means to get out of poverty. There are hundreds of examples - dozens just in the last three years proving this is so. Remember that a large percentage of the different stimuli came to Ohio, yet our unemployment rose during that time."

Look at her behaviors still no remorse and no regard it's all about her. She should get the death penalty and this judge needs to step up and do her job because this is looking more like a circus. Unbelievable hat she has done to tear up his family. And her family don't even get me started! Anyone who does wrong needs to be held accountable family or not.

We are not the enemy as we have been treated for far too long. We are scapegoats when there is no one else to blame. To introduce such a bill is shameful and speaks loudly the value you place on federal employees."

He needs to round up all those in office who believe that saving this country from destruction is the only thing that is important and take action. Future campaign, their job security, their pensions, are not important at this time. There is plenty of time for all that when this country is back on track to being ""ONE NATION UNDER GOD""!"

China isn't happy when the Fed stiffed them on their gold from the 1930s (which they sent here for ""safekeeping"" from the Japanese). They wanted it in the late 1990s. From what I understand, gold under the WTC was supposed to be sent to repay China but then 9/11 happened and the gold ended up in Paraguay...then who knows where."

This bill negates the 4th, 5th, and 6th Amendment of our Bill of Rights and initializes Martial Law in the United States. You owe America an explanation for your signing a bill that trashes our freedoms."

I love what you stand for, but, I can not reasonably see how you can catch up even winning Florida. My opinion is that you would do yourself a favor by bowing out before you get hammered in your home state. We need you to fight again some day and not be damaged by what some are saying could be a huge loss in your home family. Conservatives need you to fight again .... be blessed..."

On a parallel track, now is the time to resurrect the idea of support for the International Court as a step in bringing a lawful resolution to what is alleged to have happened. For now, NO!"

It makes for a great explosion upon impact and the heat is much greater than that of a normal fire. But, you would never believe anything but the moronic idea that the Government somehow planned all of this in order to start a war (but, of course, they didn't in the case of Bosnia in order to get the people to forget about Clinton's ""problems.""). By the way, Paul; I also believe we went to the moon and that the Earth is round!!! :O"

1,"A few sets (~5 reps) of bw squats can be a good warm-up before barbell squats. I do two sets with just the bar to warm up before adding weight, but for some 20kg will be too close to work weights for it to not affect their work sets.High rep sets of bw squats can be a good part of a bodyweight cardio circuit too. I wouldn't do lots of reps immediately before or immediately after barbell squats though.I also use unweighted squats to stretch."

What amazed me most though, was the plants that were put into the message boards to keep it going and even turning the medias attention away from Caylee and Casey. Did your job well.

Here are the facts: Statistically speaking, MOST polls show that Senator Sanders has a much higher chance in winning the general election when compared to Secretary Clinton. He has the support of the Independent voters and some moderate Republicans. In addition, the claim to fame of the Democratic party is that they represent the 99%. The status quo and small incremental changes are not going to help the 99%. Senator Sanders' policies will. As a super delegate we PLEAD AND BEG you to vote for Senator Sanders and help save the USA, the 99% and the planet. Thank you. [[PHOTO]]"

If it does are you Ok with that? I am Ok with that. Peoples religious views & their view of God affects how they govern but I understand that no view should be endorsed by the state. It seems that you have a certain hostility of views of faith. Want to explain? Balls in your court. Also the Supreme Court is not always right you know.

0,"""repatriation"" ? Ya'll came up with a new word for tax break for corporations. Why don't you just end the corporate welfare and let the Bush tax cuts expire? That will increase the GDP, help with the deficeit. Then you you could address the trade imbalances with other countries and give incentives to American companies to move back here. Then kill repeal NAFTA, CAFTA and any other ""AFTA"" to bring more jobs back here. Encourage corporations and industries to ""partner"" with local High Schools and Technical colleges to create the education and skills necessary to provide a skilled American workforce ready to work. Cut off all educational aid to foreign college students and only provide aid to American students. That would be a good start."

Bernie is like the Pied Piper spreading fairy dust, making promises he can't keep, like free college education. In spite of his apparent youthful energy, Bernie will be 75 before the election, way past retirement age. In the U.S., 44% of people 75-84 years old have Alzheimer's Disease.

I consider myself independent, leaning to the right a little. I personally voted for Bush, twice! And in '08, the Republicans lost my vote, solely based on Obama's promises of getting rid of both the Patriot Act and Guantanamo. Not only were those promises not kept, but he continues to try and usurp more power than that granted by the already overreaching bad legislation that is the Patriot Act. There is not any room for politics when it comes to the choice of true freedom vs the freedom of the gilded cage."

We are not the keepers of the free world and if these countries cannot keep their financial commitments to be part of the NATO alliance they should be removed. It is in all cases fair for everyone involved. If you join a labor union and dont pay your dues, do you get the benefits of being in the union. No you don't this is real life, and everyone involved needs to pull their own weight."

1,"I received SNAP for a few months in the end of 2008 when my husband and I lost our jobs at the same time. The monthly amount was a lot more than we needed. Not only did we have $ left over, we had enough to purchase luxury food items as well. We had two kids. That's a simple fact. I saw the same with a family that received snap for a single parent with four kids. Money to spare, and plenty for expensive junk food whenever they wanted. But how many will admit or advertise? Likely those that would be willing may also be ashamed to admit they used it...like me."

0,"If you're trying to log a workout and then log more afterwards for the day, then you just keep adding the extra things, and every time you save, it is effectively overwriting what you had before, so you don't need to delete anything - you should have absolutely everything you've done that day under Track. Deleting anything will result in it not being logged. Not sure if that's what you were referring to...?"
1,i am sure about that Tyra!!!!!!!
1,How do we pay the adult child caring for an aged parent with dementia or even a mother who wants to stay home with a young child? How do we support poets and artists who never sell their work but enrich our lives? Every Individual should receive a Basic Income so that they might be Free and dependent upon no one who could be their Oppressor. We need to re-define work as that we choose to do to make the world a better place unconnected to any reward we might get other than the satisfaction of a job well done

1,The pharmaceuticals and private insurance companies run our medical system. Opiates abound as Doctors seem more interested in getting kick backs from drug companies to treat symptoms rather than cure diseases. Add to that the food industry--our own beloved Cargill--decides what is nutrition over the heads of educators and scientists. On top of this mob of gold diggers we are to take seriously the candidacy Republican presidential candidates--headed up by a billionaire tycoon. Too much power in the conniving hands too few.

He then tried to walk it back and looked ridiculous.

And in fact, he's really only against one in particular: Bailouts approved by Mitt Romney: ‚Ä¢ Wall Street (2008) ‚Ä¢ Salt Lake City Winter Olympics (2002) ‚Ä¢ GS Tech, owned by Bain (2002) ‚Ä¢ Bain & Co. Consulting (1993) Bailouts opposed by Mitt Romney: ‚Ä¢ American auto industry (2009) So when it came to bailing out Wall Street or his own enterprises, Romney was thumbs up. And when it came to taking tens of millions in public subsidies for companies in which he invested, Romney was thumbs up too. But when it came to the American auto industry, he said no way. Let it go bankrupt. To do anything else would have been Communism, you see?"

0,"Mallory Verner is in law school, yet she doesn't even know it's unconstitutional for the federal government to require anything at all regarding the 2nd Amendment. They have no constitutional authority whatsoever over the 2nd Amendment. Apparently, Mallory is a liberal, which would explain her ignorance of and/or contempt for the Constitution."

1,"While I see that you still advocate for Keystone, but remember only IDIOTS would accept that pipeline that brings CANADIAN tarsands over aquifers that we know will leak, for a very few jobs, that NONE of the oil or profits will end up in the US. Wake the heck up and vote against this lunacy. NOTHING for us unless you are heavily invested in those CANADIAN companies. Which brings up your position, LYNN. The only thought now is that you want it for YOUR profits Lynn and care not for us here in Kansas. After all, you probably have moved to Virginia like Pat did."

1,"I'd recommend prioritising the weights over the cardio. Read something like Mark Rippetoe's Starting Strength. Get a routine together than includes the big compound lifts (starting light of course), then add some easy cardio where you can fit it in (walking for example). As you develop strength you'll also be burning bodyfat. Also, pay less attention to the numbers on the scales and more to what you see in the mirror :)This has been working well for me for the last few months"

1,"It was the most expensive gin I have ever tasted and it was delicious. It made Bombay Sapphire taste like methylated spirits in comparison. I felt like such a preppy douchebag, which incidentally was the the theme of the party. By the time I got home it was too late to head to the gym to further widen the gap between our respective tallies. I also didn't count yesterday's 2km walk around the park in my total. It wouldn't have earned me bulk points, but it would've been enough :P"

1,"McCaskill is a true ""suckup."" She has masked her true agenda and voted in the most supportive manner with present administration. She supported the ""Obama Health Care Plan"" and lacks the depth of knowledge on Second Amendment issues by voting for basically feel good solutions. Now she wants to support a person who says ""Why does it matter?"" Well, it sure does matter when US citizens die doing their job!!!!!!!! And, we got 5 more years of McCaskill!!!!!!"
1,"In my opinion, 250,000 words later on this trial ""This is a legal system...not a justice system and it is failing. Failing by not incarcerating the guilty and incarcerating the innocent."" I believe this was an excellent circumstantial evidence case and more for guilt. However, what the jurors were allowed to see and not see, the charging documents, the legal gamesmanship for the "" higher purpose"" of publicity and more played a big role in this trial. A ""fair trial"" for this woman became another expensive slap in the face of justice, should lady justice still be standing."

I think they have shouted from the rooftops that they do NOT care about American lives, and they DO care about all the money the NRA pours into gun lobbies. That will not change as long as special interests lobbies are allowed to donate millions of dollars to government officials. The streets could run red with blood and they will still do NOTHING. That is stating their position LOUD and clear."

She sure seemed to be taking a chance he wasn't already guilty of so much she knew nothing about. Did she think she caught him before he started acting on it? That's taking a whole lot for granted and not showing much care for that little boy!! That's why this whole thing smacks of LIES!!!"

0,"Hey Quirinius, thanks for remembering me. I've still been plugging away in the gym, just haven't been that motivated to post my stuff on Fitocracy lately. I guess I was using it to help motivate myself and got to the point where I didn't really need it anymore. The actual posting part can be a little difficult because I usually go straight from the gym to work and then either have to post from a cell phone on my break or remember when I get home ~10 hours after the workout."

0,Why not push to bring back the Steel Industry top the U.S. Or for that matter any sustainable maufacturing industry? The job estimates for the pipeline are all over the place.

He was mentally slow and I kept my child inside because of him. He did pull the gun on a 4 yr. old boy because he was knocking on a door. He called himself the mayor of our small town and had a CB radio with so much power that we could not watch TV or use our phones. These hot heads should not be allowed to do this.,"

Clinton went on to run for President & then as Secretary of State....no one can say she's not intelligent......brave. Emails? Please. I've deleted thousands of them myself. Just look at the opponent: narcissistic, pathological, a liar.....at least Clinton defends people's rights. She's survived the media storms before & she can take our country in the right direction. Pro-Choice/Pro-America/Pro-Peace/Pro-Clinton. That is all. Marla Simpson, M.A. Election Year 2016 11/8/16 ****And fyi I called the FBI myself about a situation a few years ago.

0,our senator we can honestly count on.
0,She may have been born in NC. But she grew up and was educated in FLA. There was a reason why she came back to NC because it's a Blue state. Fla is red state. Now NC has gone back to being a Red state in Decades her days are surely numbered. I highly recommend to do a lengthy search on the next candidates for office. Do not take there word. They would say anything to just to get elected. Do a through wiki or internet search and know there back ground and where they come from. If they come from wealth they do not represent you in any shape or form. As these individuals only seek office to get even richer.

And maybe if we gave President Obama a trillion dollars to spend, he would put that toward jobs. Oh wait. We did and he gave it to his cronies for voting for him. Like the half billion dollars he gave to Solyndra right before they went bankrupt. Well, at least he keeps the Secret Service hopping what with Michele's trips to Spain, Sasha's trip to Mexico, and his trip to El Salvador. At least the Secret Service could afford to employ the hookers. Talk about 'job generator'. LOL"

0,"What's the news regarding getting Michelle Bachmann canned? It is comforting that she's really done nothing...but help whip up a nonsensical torrent of fear. Currently, the Republican tactic is to collectively ""do nothing"" to get their way, stomping and huffing and puffing like little crybabies. They do have one thing over the Democrats: solidarity. She's such a loud-mouthed moron--I don't think the Republicans have or want anything else. They're all about show and horse-race and attention bids, so there's really no room for substance. In fact, ""substance"" is a bad thing. It's what those pinko Socialist ivory-tower over-educated liberals have!"

0,Squat form is tough. Every few months I feel like I have to go back and read about form just to re-educate myself and make sure I'm doing it right. One thing that might help is to go down without weight at first and then use your elbows to push your knees outward to get a stretch. Then when you add weight focus on not letting your knees go too wide or too narrow and keep your feet pointed in the same direction as your knees are. _squats

As power gradually transfers from business to the masses, the globe will sink or rise on the values of the consumer. Time to refresh democracy - encourage local stewardship of the environment. What would you have the ambition to do locally for Hawaii given complete freedom to do so? Could it be an example of fully sustainable living on this planet? What are you in politics to do?"

My wife's coworkers were those killed in San Bernardino, so you, Lindsey, can do what you told Trump to do."

A majority of Floridians have already spoken. Two years ago, nearly 58 percent of voters said doctors should be able to prescribe medical marijuana for people with certain conditions. But because 60 percent is needed to pass a state constitutional amendment, the measure died. This year, the push to legalize medical marijuana is back as Amendment 2.

But now, with puberty causing him to miss social cues, I am frightened for him as he starts high school next week.

The purchase won't be wasted because you can buy another 25 and learn gorilla cleans, double snatches and double swings. Once your form on all those is perfect, you can jump to a 35. When I'm at home, I'll usually use the 44s for weight and versatility, only switching to higher weights when I'm in the gym."

Page 4 of the article says: ""claims processors struggle with understaffing, an incomplete software system and paper claims that must be shipped around the country in boxes..."".

0,"One of the ways he gains control of the population is by passing bills that are hidden or tagged to another bill. If each bill had to stand on it's own merits and be voted on individually, and our reps did THEIR JOB, maybe we would have a chance at regaining America. This megalomaniac is getting control one bill at a time. If he gets the guns and breaks the constitution, there will be no stopping him. He could declare marshall law and there is not one thing you could do about it. He could declare himself dictator and you could not stop him. Is that what you Obama idiots want?"

As a moderate college student I highly respect you and your unique moderate republican brand. Don't want to taint it by endorsing a racist, sexist (and probably rapist) islamaphobic con-man.

0,"This ""train wreck"" started out with the idea that everyone should have health insurance, including people with pre-existing conditions and those who simply and truly could not afford it Rather than fix the problem. Obamacare throws out the baby with the bathwater and decimates the entire health delivery system. In addition, this ""universal"" coverage will exempt certain privileged groups. In my mind, this is discrimination. The questionnaires are overly intrusive and probably violate HIPAA. It's a bad law and should be repealed. Obama WANTS socialism, and this is its entre' into it."

1,"I just recently learned that Edmund Pettus was a Civil War general, and after the War he became head (""Grand Dragon"") of the KKK in Alabama. Having his name displayed so prominently is as much a slap in the face as showing the Confederate battle flag.

I did have a guy recommend to me alternating short (1 minute or so) sprints with weight work, with no break in between.. I did it for about 10 minutes and was exhausted, although he said half an hour would be ideal. I've also found doing a 15 minute kettlebell circuit without putting down the bell to be pretty hard too.."

This guy should have been impeached on at least six different issues. First and formost he IS NOT a Natural born citizen. His Father and Mother had to be citizens of the USA when he was born to qualify as natural Born. He is what is called a Native Citizen. That should be enough to impeach alone. He went outside the Constitution to become President.

1,"The problem will be that women will be going to butchers again. U won't stop abortions, folks. It should never be a form of birth control, but there are times when a woman should be able tomake a choice & have a safe place to have the abortion.

Obama's DHS added the countries of Libya, Somalia, & Yemen to the Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015. This is already law & Trump is only using the law just like other Democratic Presidents did such as Obama & Bill Clinton, who got a standing ovation in applause too-bet you were there & applauded Bill too, Cory Booker!

Please start a 'non-partisan' Pride Campaign (look it up) to bring back integrity to the Congress and start outing and shaming those who act in corrupt ways. Additionally would like to see WA state get together and publish a plan for how you are going to keep people safe, healthy, and employed. We have thousands of smart problem solvers in WA.

0,"Reportedly if Obama chooses to bow his neck in defiance of congress on coming up with a plan to get out of debt, that he can issue an executive order to raise the debt ceiling, even though it would be unprecedented and very unwise for him to do that. However, even with that...congress still has to vote to give him the money. Basically, you hold the purse string. If you vote no, Obama has to have your and fellow congressmen's vote(s) in order for his plan of defiance to work. Thank you for not voting for Obama until he has a plan to get out of debt."

They realize that people who are trafficked often end up as sa ""source of revenue"" for the abortion industry."

I told the little piss ant that someplace that calls itself a judgement-free zone should take it easy on the name calling, and that treating me like I'm some idiot meathead because I actually want to work out was a pretty moronic position for a gym to take.

1,"A ""homegoing service"" is an old term used by Black church community (in my experience Baptist and Pentecostal churches). It means instead of mourning the death of someone, you celebrate the fact that they are ""going home"" to be with God. There's praying, preaching, singing,shouting (another church term for when someone is in the Holy Spirit) and praising God for allowing us to have had someone in our lives. I had been thinking all day that America is about to see a true homegoing, and when Jane asked that question I kind of chuckled because that just validated my thought. Whitney Houston's family is deeply rooted in church and that is why they are having a homegoing for her."

1,"If you don't want abortions, then you EDUCATE the children about sex! You tell them how to protect themselves, how to handle the reality of being a sexual being. You do not hide your head in the ground pretending kids will never have sex until they are ready to raise children. You don't pretend! You don't deny biology and medicine because it ""makes you uncomfortable"". Grow up, this is just a way to ensure a desperately dumbed down cheap labor force for our corporate masters."
0,Constituent comment: Thank you for your service Chris. I presume as a man who embraces leftist values you think Climate Change is one of mankind most pressing problems. I presume you think we should radically degrade the American economy by severe ( and un-Constitutional) federal controls on fossil fuels. Maybe take a look at the 5 minute video by one of the worlds greatest climate scientists and educate your constituents about why he is wrong. I always comment with deep respect for you as a good man but disrespect for your leftist ideas and values. take care: Howard Sachs -science/climate-change-what-do-scientists-say

1,"Hi Mrs. Roby, I just went onto the ""healthcare"" website. The information I put in was for a 22yr old male, earning 5,000 a year. He does not smoke, drink or have any, any, any illnesses of any kind. The lowest cost was 165.00 a month, with a 3,000 co-pay which had to be paid before the 30.00 co-pay for the doctor's office would be covered. So here we have a young man whose estimated earnings for 2014 will be $5,000. and ""Obamacare"" expects him to pay $3,000 a year before he would get any health coverage. WHAT? This is nuts."

0,"Remember how Obamacare was going to destroy insurance for everyone, and how employers were going to stop providing coverage? Yeah, that didn't happen either. The rate of people insured by an employer has remained pretty much stable since 2013, 44.2 percent in the final quarter of that year and 43.4 percent in the second quarter of this year. But now 20.9 percent of people report they are in a plan bought on the individual market by themselves or a family member, up from 17.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013. The percentage covered by Medicaid has increased from 6.9 percent to 9.5. Clearly a disaster for America. -Obamacare-continues-historic-downward-nbsp-slide?detail=email"

Here are the facts: Statistically speaking, MOST polls show that Senator Sanders has a much higher chance in winning the general election when compared to Secretary Clinton. He has the support of the Independent voters and some moderate Republicans. In addition, the claim to fame of the Democratic party is that they represent the 99%. The status quo and small incremental changes are not going to help the 99%. Senator Sanders' policies will.

0,Thank you Buddy Carter for doing your part in trying to defund PP. Perhaps money should be directed to educating the public on birth control. ACA has been a disaster for many families. I have private insurance and my premiums went up 100% I feel as if I'm footing the bill for those not working. I basically bring home $200.00 a month after I pay for insurance for my family. Many people were either let go or made part time employees because of company coverage. So while it might be great from some it is not for all. There has got to be a better plan.

Maintaining a cut is a lot harder for those who have trouble losing weight or keeping it off.

Three of the court's more conservative members dissented, saying they would have allowed officials to require identification. The requirement, one of the strictest in the nation, is part of a state law enacted in 2011 but mostly blocked by various courts in the interim. A federal trial judge had blocked it, saying it would ""deter or prevent a substantial number of the 300,000-plus registered voters who lack ID from voting,"" disproportionately affecting black and Hispanic voters."

Our family pays 1280.00 in med ins coverage for 4 with a 10000.00 deductible. We can try this Obamacare and fix along the way. Scrapping and starting over will take years. I am a republican I vote.

I want to be optimistic. I am tried of the negativity and perpetual cynicism. We need a positive mental attitude adjustment all across our fruited plain by all citizens and leaders.

0,"The silent killer, yea. WHat's more; no joke: Washington wants to teach you how to manage money this is not an April Fool's joke. Obama has issued a Presidential proclamation declaring April 2013 to be .. National Financial Capability Month! The proclamation reads, ""Together, we can prepare young people to tackle financial challenges -- from learning how to budget responsibly to saving for college, starting a business, or opening a retirement account."" It also states, ""I call upon all Americans to observe this month with programs and activities to improve their understanding of financial principles and practices."" .."
0,"Clinton also told a housing trade group in 2013 that on certain issues, she has ""a public and a private position."" ""If everybody's watching, you know, all of the back room discussions and the deals, you know, then people get a little nervous, to say the least,"" said Clinton. ""So, you need both a public and a private position."" ASK HER WHICH HILLARY ARE FOLKS VOTING FOR, THE PUBLIC OR THE PRIVATE ONE? WHAT DETERMINES HER PRIVATE POSITIONS? DOES HAVING A PUBLIC AND PRIVATE POSITIONS ON ISSUES UNDERMINE DEMOCRACY? Jill not Hill or Dill!"

0,Here's a little something from an American person. DO NOT NEGOTIATE WITH REPUBLICANS! You will lose and so will we. Stand firm. Do not compromise just to get some crumbs that are thrown our way. I would rather we didn't get anything but didn't lose anything either rather than give away the entire farm just to get a chicken or two. We will be watching and holding you accountable.
0,"JH - Well whose going to pay for that? 250,000 Public Employees randomly tested just once a year...well over 12 Million Dollars. As far a drug testing parents of needy families at least another 1.5 Million for one drug test per year. From my experience, that would not be very effective besides being very expensive. We need to be looking for ways to cut our budgets rather than increasing them. Bottom line, to carry out increased Govt. Programs, we need to raise taxes. Raising taxes stagnates job growth, and we certainly have had enough of that lately."

Once we get the deficit down to at least 700 billion (which is where it was AFTER the bailout with Bush), then we should talk about raising taxes. FIRST cut back to Bush levels (even with the 300 billion bailout), then let's talk about raising taxes.

1,"Well I have one more comment. The evidence fore abuse in this case is all through the trial. How he used her for sex while saying to his friends that she was a stalker. The way he talked to her, the physical and mental control. It's funny how nobody ever saw her stalk him or slash his tires or for that matter go thru the alleged doggy door. All of these things were talked about to his friends by Travis. I think that is rather odd. So no the expert does have more than Jodi's word. All of you say well she never reported it well here she is reporting it and you see what happens nobody believes the abused."

You are imposing your moral beliefs on other people. Well played sir. What a wonderful example of the small government that you claim to love so much.

0,"Some people are saying she needs psychological help, agreed. But to says she's doing this because she is delusional is dead wrong. ""Crazy"" people don't know they are crazy. Meaning... If a reporter catches you in a lie you don't ""Badeep badeep badeep, that's all folks"" and turn and run away from them. A ""crazy"" person would ""righteously"" defend herself against the man whose saying the sky is white and she saying the sky is black. Crazy people like that don't run away when caught in a lie, because they truly don't think they are lying. She is more like the ""Yeah, yeah, that's the ticket"" kind of liar. Hypocritical lying thief that uses what's ever tactics called for at the particular moment she's needs it for."

Because Bernie Sanders is not backed by oil companies, wall street, the pharmaceutical industry and other big money donors, he is the only candidate that truly has everyone best interest at heart. How can you support a candidate who is the exact opposite? Please listen to the voters, A Bernie Sanders supporter Of Michigan #sanders2016 #ournextpresident #listentothevoters #feelthebern"

I respected you ONCE. .... Never another dime or vote from me, Teddy Boy. I left in the GOPExit.

However, as my elected Congressman, I am very disappointed that you cast a big NO vote on the bill to form a House select committee to investigate what really happened in Benghazi.

How defeating for my daughter, a teacher, to have to succumb to the ideals of a national ""leader""of her profession who does not have near the education (Two Master's Degrees) and experience my daughter has obtained.

0,Coming from a man voted into office in the land the native americans were driven to on a trail of death and inconceivable atrocities. Then this land was taken as well. The native americans have paid a heavy price just being alive in a land they were born in. To me it is time that we have a few more victories and less murders. Less stolen in the name of prosperity. Less stolen in the name of progression. We as americans should not turn a blind eye.

1,"Despite being a hated ""Republican"", I agree that the earnings cap needs to be removed and SS strengthened for future generations. You do need to take a hard look at ""disability"" however as we encourage more people not to work. Also need to rein in unearned benefits to those who did not contribute, i.e. the great ""undocumented"" class. Our forefathers who immigrated had to work to support themselves and their families as they were not allowed to go on the dole."
1,I agree with voting against this bill. But why is it when a Democrat votes no and almost shuts the Government down it is consider courageous or patriotic but if a Republican votes against something they think is wrong they are considered hostage takers or crazy etc... We need our Representatives to start voting for what is right and in Americas best interest and not based on the letter next to there name.

1,It is interesting to see how many people thank you Patty for your support of the military. I wonder how many parents really feel good about having their young men and women serving overseas now knowing that this administration (and that means you Patty) does not have their back and considers them expendable if an election is coming up? This whole Benghazi issue is sickening and the Democrats have circled the wagons protecting the president and hillary. No one has taken responsibility. No one has been fired. Step up Patty and be responsible yourself. You are a mother. Is this the way that you would want to be treated if your son was killed over there?

0,"""Anyone who can't be trusted with a gun can't be trusted without a custodian."" Gun rights author and activist David Codrea frequently uses this as the litmus test for determining whether or not someone should be deprived of their right to self-defense. Because, if a person shouldn't have a gun, he arguably shouldn't be in any position to get hold of a 2-ton vehicle, or a can of gasoline, or a baseball bat either. Application of this rule could save hours of debate on silly and unconstitutional laws attempting to deprive people of their inalienable rights."

I use to work on a rape/suicide hotline, one girl , I knew by association , went to a bar not intent on drinking at all, her close friends backed her up, woke up the next morning in a strange mans room with 6 other guys. She was drugged at the bar taken back to their place and RAPED! Cops did nothing. Even after the hospital report PROVED she was drugged with NO alcohol in her system! So you are just as bad as these men who raped her. And one day will probably rape a woman and say she was asking for it."

Either would make a good president. And you might be right that Hillary may be able to get things done more smoothly. But I am just SO SICK of establishment politics that I am caucusing for Bernie. I find your endorsement of Clinton encouraging. At least I'll feel better about it if I wind up voting for her. Thanks for that. I respect your opinion."

Hobby Lobby should no longer sell anything, or profit from anything that goes against their ""so called"" beliefs. Until then, just a bunch of profiteering going on....hypocrites!"

Many of the provisions to protect American jobs were never enforced, and grand ideas to ""re-train"" displaced workers in ""information"" technology that was supposed to take the place of production line labor never materialized. Maybe we need trade agreements, but those negotiating them should not be na√Øve about the consequences.

Obama has strongly centrist instincts, and I'm guessing he particularly wanted to find experienced people for economic policy positions, which pretty much meant people who'd been in the Clinton White House, which pretty much meant people under the influence of Robert Rubin (in contrast with people who were closer to Pres. Obama's own orientation, which tended toward behavioral economics). Not sure why Pres. Obama thought Geithner would be better at Treasury, other than that Summers had been there and done that, and that Geithner might be more likely to calm the nerves of Wall Street. My own speculation, mostly."

IDK if that's right or wrong. I just picked one way to log stuff like that and do so consistently for my own tracking purposes."

Fire was my flip side of the coin as a civilian, if I was ever denied entry for something that was non-correctable. You have to be tough for both, but, generally, one requires that you may have to take a life, and the other you may be the only one who could save one."

0,"Since the network was already owned by the number one defense contractor on earth it was hard to imagine the situation getting any worse. And yet it has. So let's review. We've got ultra-reactionary Rupert Murdock and his Fox team on the right and now we've got defense contractor/ultra-conservative software company/cable conglomerate owned NBC/MSNBC holding up the goal post on the left. And that's supposed to be the full spectrum of relevant political opinion?? I say GOOD to this merger. The starker the absurdity of this corporate media situation becomes, the harder it will be for people to ignore it along with becoming harder to ignore journalists like Amy Goodman."

But we were all there to tell you that that we had concerns about the ACA repeal and we did not support it. I, specifically, asked your office staff to tell you to vote No to budget reconciliation. We saw you leaving out the side door while we were held up in the waiting room and not let in to speak with you. We were told that it would be a 5 week wait to schedule to speak with you, which is after the date of the scheduled repeal vote. If you haven't heard from us, it's because you are avoiding us. #protectourcare [[PHOTO]]"

If all you put in is time, the system assumes you're just sort of ambling along, not putting out any real effort. You need to tell it otherwise so it can give you credit."

1,"All I believe is that MJ fans don't want anyone to say anything negative against... him at all...if it was someone else in the media they didn't like it would be a different story...that's what I see anyway. I think Dr. Murray should be held responsible for all the drugs he administered but we can't blame Dr. Murray for all the drugs MJ took prior to meeting him! Michael Jackson knew the dangers of what he was doing...that obviously was more important to him than his family, kids or anything else...I think MJ thought he was above the law and could do anything he wanted."

0,"I'd say up the weight 5 lbs again, and see how many reps you get and how you feel. With this program you should always leave one rep in the tank (don't go to failure). See how the first set of 8 feels. If you feel like you get 8 but were kinda close to failure, then keep the weight for the second set. You'll probably get 6. Then obviously if you only got 6 then you'd need to drop the weight for the third set. But if the first set is relatively easy to hit 8, you won't lose those 2 reps."

0,Fuck trump with your ugly guy
0,"Again, its time for the people to have their say and make their requests known. The ""leaders"" have had their chance. It's time for the American people to take the initiative and regain control of this situation. Healthcare wasn't the issue discussed in that article, but rather how insurance can help to get control. Problem is people can pay for cheaper insurance if they save for it on their own. Pay for it out of pocket and be prepared. No more relying on the gooberment to take care of us.

Among those without ethics reports are billionaire Betsy DeVos to head the Department of Education, and John Kelly to lead the Department of Homeland Security. And, of course, there's Trump himself, who refuses to disclose his assets, refuses to disclose his taxes, and refuses to put his holdings in a blind trust."

Teachers,police,fire,construction and other spinoffs. These investments would b offset by a 5% surtax on people with incomes over 1mil $. Senators stabenow, Levin and most other democrats voted to move forward with debate and a final passage vote. Every single republican voted against it. Now , who is voting to improve the position of job creators?? And who is in the pockets of the plutocrats?"

There are many social issues at bay, that go along with bullying. Maybe we should spend more money on parent education and less on laws."

0,"Sending arms to Syria is a huge mistake. This is none of our business. Plus, these people hate us, it doesn't matter if they support Assad or Al-Qaeda. But the big question I want answered is will Obama conduct background checks on people getting these weapons? Will he limit the size of the magazines? Who is going to have those weapons when the war is over? Will the US Military go police up these weapons? Seems to me that it's only fair Obama put the same restrictions on them that he wants to put on us."

Remember that you start all lifts with an empty bar, so 5x5 will be easy for quite a while. Personally, my gut tells me you would get nearly the same results in less time doing 3 sets instead of 5, but that's up to you. Look for an email from me in the next couple minutes."

0,Why should TRUMP apologize for something Sidney Blumenthal started back in 2008???? I just can't stand you anymore - there was a time I respected you. Afraid you won't be part of the ESTABLISHMENT anymore if Trump is elected? You are irrelevant to America - shut up and go away.
0,".......so many leaders turned a ""blind eye"" during the holocaust...:(...Drink in Peace ;)"
0,"Speedy thanks! :) waiting does sux! Ankle now acting weird, knee hurting a wee bit less! Meh? Keeping my fingers crossed! You a swueeet heart!"
0,"Thank God Trump spoke up when he did. Obama was going to abstain which the U.S. has never done on such a resolution regarding Israel. To abstain means that the resolution would have passed which in effect, in the eyes of the U.N., would remove Israel's sovereignty. Just one more display of obama's evil."

They wont the three hundred million of the rest of us to completely forget about what we believe and if we don't their going to punish states and schools by withholding federal funds.This is the way this administration works. Strange way to use our own money. Absolutely disgusting.
1,Crappy push-up>no push-up
0,Damn dude this is quite insightful. Learn a lot about it
0,"""I doubt we'll have that kind of a state of the union address tonight?"" So this statement preemptively sets the tone that Obama will fail, and contributes to the very problem that you're claiming to want to move past. Hopefully you did not leave early and miss the part where Obama indeed spoke to these concerns as someone who also cares deeply about this country. I've never heard of you, and I'm sadly disappointed, though not surprised, to hear you feed the cynicism that so pervades your occupation . So let me put it plainly, You Sir are part of the problem. Be the change you seek!"
1,What's going on?? Your liver???
0,"As a member of your district I emphatically implore you to end the government shutdown. Immediately. I am embarrassed by you and your fellow Republicans. I do not support your actions. You must allow a legally passed law to be enacted as voted on, I believe your behavior to be narcissistic, childish and contrary to the best interests of our nation. If you do not separate yourself from the right wing (nuts), I will do everything in my power as a constituent to ensure you are NOT reelected."

0,HOW in the world can leaders in good conscience even vote on a bill that no one has read or debated on in great length. NO bill should be more that 20 pages long.

0,"A vote for Larson is a vote for Pres. Obama , after I said this I have to go wash my mouth out . I feel sick and disgusted. Worst president since the dirty rotten Jimmy Carter"
0,"I agree. When then the government gets off the backs of entrepreneurs they can fulfill their dreams and create opportunities for others. I appreciate all the hard work you have been doing in the House. I think you have done a good job. More importantly, your constituency thinks you have done a good job and the polls seem to indicate you will win reelection easily. After the election next week, I trust you will continue leading the House in its efforts to promote the American market economy. That is what the founding fathers wanted and that is what most Americans still want."

As to the reason for my training : I spent almost all of 2012 in hospital, weeks in ITU and months in HDU at the end of which I could not stand up or walk due to muscle loss . Had to push myself hard to learn to walk again and really I haven't stopped pushing since. Now loving the gym and feeling the fittest I have felt since I was 20. Don't want this feeling to stop and I have to stick around for my 2 kids who are a very powerful motivator to keep going"
